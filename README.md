# SimpleStorage.sol
A simple Solidity smart contract for storing and retrieving a value.

Overview
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates basic concepts of smart contract development. The contract includes functions for setting and getting a stored value.

Features
Set Function: Allows users to set a new value.
Get Function: Returns the currently stored value.

Usage
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Compile the Contract: Use a Solidity compiler (e.g., solc) to compile the contract.
Deploy the Contract: Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum testnet).

Code Explanation
The contract uses Solidity version ^0.8.0. It includes two main functions:

set(uint x): Sets the stored value to x.
get(): Returns the currently stored value.

Example Code

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint public storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
